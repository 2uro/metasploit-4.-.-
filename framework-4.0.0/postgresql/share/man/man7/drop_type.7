Automatically drop objects that depend on the type (such as
table columns, functions, operators).

the default.

To remove the data type \fBbox\fR:

DROP TYPE box;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
This command is similar to the corresponding command in the SQL
standard, apart from the IF EXISTS
option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
But note that the \fBCREATE TYPE\fR command
and the data type extension mechanisms in
PostgreSQL differ from the SQL standard.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
CREATE TYPE [\fBcreate_type\fR(7)], ALTER TYPE [\fBalter_type\fR(7)]
