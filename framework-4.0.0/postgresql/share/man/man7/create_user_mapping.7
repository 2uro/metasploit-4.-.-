.SH NAME
CREATE USER MAPPING \- define a new mapping of a user to a foreign server

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR { \fIusername\fR | USER | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC }
    SERVER \fIservername\fR
    [ OPTIONS ( \fIoption\fR '\fIvalue\fR' [ , ... ] ) ]
.sp

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBCREATE USER MAPPING\fR defines a mapping of a user
to a foreign server. A user mapping typically encapsulates
connection information that a foreign-data wrapper uses together
with the information encapsulated be a foreign server to access an
external data resource.
.PP
The owner of a foreign server can create user mappings for that
server for any user. Also, a user can create a user mapping for
his own user name if USAGE privilege on the server has
been granted to the user.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIusername\fB\fR
The name of an existing user that is mapped to foreign server.
CURRENT_USER and USER match the name of
the current user. When PUBLIC is specified, a
so-called public mapping is created that is used when no
user-specific mapping is applicable.
.TP
\fB\fIservername\fB\fR
The name of an existing server for which the user mapping is
to be created.
.TP
\fBOPTIONS ( \fIoption\fB '\fIvalue\fB' [, ... ] )\fR
This clause specifies the options of the user mapping. The
options typically define the actual user name and password of
the mapping. Option names must be unique. The allowed option
names and values are specific to the server's foreign-data wrapper.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Create a user mapping for user bob, server foo:
.sp
.nf
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR bob SERVER foo OPTIONS (user 'bob', password 'secret');
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
