.SH NAME
ALTER AGGREGATE \- change the definition of an aggregate function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
ALTER AGGREGATE \fIname\fR ( \fItype\fR [ , ... ] ) RENAME TO \fInew_name\fR
ALTER AGGREGATE \fIname\fR ( \fItype\fR [ , ... ] ) OWNER TO \fInew_owner\fR
ALTER AGGREGATE \fIname\fR ( \fItype\fR [ , ... ] ) SET SCHEMA \fInew_schema\fR
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBALTER AGGREGATE\fR changes the definition of an
aggregate function.
.PP
You must own the aggregate function to use \fBALTER AGGREGATE\fR.
To change the schema of an aggregate function, you must also have
CREATE privilege on the new schema.
To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on
the aggregate function's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering
the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating
the aggregate function. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any
aggregate function anyway.)
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIname\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing aggregate function.
.TP

To reference a zero-argument aggregate function, write *

The new name of the aggregate function.
.TP
\fB\fInew_owner\fB\fR
The new owner of the aggregate function.

\fBinteger\fR into schema myschema:
