.SH NAME
CLOSE \- close a cursor

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
CLOSE { \fIname\fR | ALL }
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBCLOSE\fR frees the resources associated with an open cursor.
After the cursor is closed, no subsequent operations
are allowed on it. A cursor should be closed when it is
no longer needed.
.PP
Every non-holdable open cursor is implicitly closed when a
transaction is terminated by \fBCOMMIT\fR or
\fBROLLBACK\fR. A holdable cursor is implicitly
closed if the transaction that created it aborts via
\fBROLLBACK\fR. If the creating transaction
successfully commits, the holdable cursor remains open until an
explicit \fBCLOSE\fR is executed, or the client
disconnects.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIname\fB\fR
The name of an open cursor to close.
.TP
\fBALL\fR
Close all open cursors.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
PostgreSQL does not have an explicit
\fBOPEN\fR cursor statement; a cursor is considered
open when it is declared. Use the
DECLARE [\fBdeclare\fR(7)]
statement to declare a cursor.
.PP
You can see all available cursors by querying the \fBpg_cursors\fR system view.
.PP
If a cursor is closed after a savepoint which is later rolled back,
the \fBCLOSE\fR is not rolled back; that is, the cursor
remains closed.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Close the cursor liahona:
.sp
.nf
CLOSE liahona;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
\fBCLOSE\fR is fully conforming with the SQL
standard. \fBCLOSE ALL\fR is a PostgreSQL
extension.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
DECLARE [\fBdeclare\fR(7)], FETCH [\fBfetch\fR(7)], MOVE [\fBmove\fR(7)]
