.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The ability to temporarily enable or disable a trigger is provided by
ALTER TABLE [\fBalter_table\fR(7)], not by
\fBALTER TRIGGER\fR, because \fBALTER TRIGGER\fR has no
convenient way to express the option of enabling or disabling all of
a table's triggers at once.

To rename an existing trigger:
.sp
.nf
ALTER TRIGGER emp_stamp ON emp RENAME TO emp_track_chgs;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
