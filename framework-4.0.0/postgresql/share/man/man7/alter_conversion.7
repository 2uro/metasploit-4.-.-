.SH NAME
ALTER CONVERSION \- change the definition of a conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
ALTER CONVERSION \fIname\fR RENAME TO \fInewname\fR
ALTER CONVERSION \fIname\fR OWNER TO \fInewowner\fR
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBALTER CONVERSION\fR changes the definition of a
conversion.
.PP
You must own the conversion to use \fBALTER CONVERSION\fR.
To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on
the conversion's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the
owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the
conversion. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any conversion
anyway.)
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIname\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing conversion.
.TP
\fB\fInewname\fB\fR
The new name of the conversion.
.TP
\fB\fInewowner\fB\fR
The new owner of the conversion.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
