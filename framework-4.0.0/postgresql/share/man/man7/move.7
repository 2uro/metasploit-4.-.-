.SH NAME
MOVE \- position a cursor

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
MOVE [ \fIdirection\fR { FROM | IN } ] \fIcursorname\fR
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBMOVE\fR repositions a cursor without retrieving any data.
\fBMOVE\fR works exactly like the \fBFETCH\fR
command, except it only positions the cursor and does not return rows.
.PP
The parameters for the \fBMOVE\fR command are identical to 
those of the \fBFETCH\fR command; refer to
FETCH [\fBfetch\fR(7)]
for details on syntax and usage.
.SH "OUTPUTS"
.PP
On successful completion, a \fBMOVE\fR command returns a command
tag of the form
.sp
.nf
MOVE \fIcount\fR
.sp
.fi
The \fIcount\fR is the number
of rows that a \fBFETCH\fR command with the same parameters
would have returned (possibly zero).
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
.nf
BEGIN WORK;
DECLARE liahona CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM films;

-- Skip the first 5 rows:
MOVE FORWARD 5 IN liahona;
MOVE 5

-- Fetch the 6th row from the cursor liahona:
FETCH 1 FROM liahona;
