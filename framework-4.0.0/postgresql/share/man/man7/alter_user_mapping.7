.SH NAME
ALTER USER MAPPING \- change the definition of a user mapping

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
ALTER USER MAPPING FOR { \fIusername\fR | USER | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC }
    SERVER \fIservername\fR
    OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] \fIoption\fR ['\fIvalue\fR'] [, ... ] )
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBALTER USER MAPPING\fR changes the definition of a
user mapping.
.PP
The owner of a foreign server can alter user mappings for that
server for any user. Also, a user can alter a user mapping for
his own user name if USAGE privilege on the server has
been granted to the user.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIusername\fB\fR
User name of the mapping. CURRENT_USER
and USER match the name of the current
user. PUBLIC is used to match all present and future
user names in the system.
.TP
\fB\fIservername\fB\fR
Server name of the user mapping.
.TP
\fBOPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] \fIoption\fB ['\fIvalue\fB'] [, ... ] )\fR
Change options for the user mapping. The new options override
any previously specified
options. ADD, SET, and DROP
specify the action to be performed. ADD is assumed
if no operation is explicitly specified. Option names must be
unique; options are also validated by the server's foreign-data
wrapper.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Change the password for user mapping bob, server foo:
.sp
.nf
ALTER USER MAPPING FOR bob SERVER foo OPTIONS (user 'bob', password 'public');
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
\fBALTER USER MAPPING\fR conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9
(SQL/MED). There is a subtle syntax issue: The standard omits
the FOR key word. Since both CREATE
USER MAPPING and DROP USER MAPPING use
FOR in analogous positions, and IBM DB2 (being
the other major SQL/MED implementation) also requires it
for ALTER USER MAPPING, PostgreSQL diverges from
the standard here in the interest of consistency and
interoperability.
