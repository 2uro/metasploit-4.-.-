.SH NAME
DROP OPERATOR CLASS \- remove an operator class

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
DROP OPERATOR CLASS [ IF EXISTS ] \fIname\fR USING \fIindex_method\fR [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBDROP OPERATOR CLASS\fR drops an existing operator class.
To execute this command you must be the owner of the operator class.
.PP
\fBDROP OPERATOR CLASS\fR does not drop any of the operators
or functions referenced by the class. If there are any indexes depending
on the operator class, you will need to specify
CASCADE for the drop to complete.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBIF EXISTS\fR
Do not throw an error if the operator class does not exist. A notice is issued 
in this case.
.TP
\fB\fIname\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator class.
.TP
\fB\fIindex_method\fB\fR
The name of the index access method the operator class is for.
.TP
\fBCASCADE\fR
Automatically drop objects that depend on the operator class.
.TP
\fBRESTRICT\fR
Refuse to drop the operator class if any objects depend on it.
This is the default.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
\fBDROP OPERATOR CLASS\fR will not drop the operator family
containing the class, even if there is nothing else left in the
family (in particular, in the case where the family was implicitly
created by \fBCREATE OPERATOR CLASS\fR). An empty operator
family is harmless, but for the sake of tidiness you might wish to
remove the family with \fBDROP OPERATOR FAMILY\fR; or perhaps
better, use \fBDROP OPERATOR FAMILY\fR in the first place.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Remove the B-tree operator class widget_ops:
.sp
.nf
DROP OPERATOR CLASS widget_ops USING btree;
.sp
.fi
This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes
that use the operator class. Add CASCADE to drop
such indexes along with the operator class.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
There is no \fBDROP OPERATOR CLASS\fR statement in the
SQL standard.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ALTER OPERATOR CLASS [\fBalter_operator_class\fR(7)], CREATE OPERATOR CLASS [\fBcreate_operator_class\fR(7)], DROP OPERATOR FAMILY [\fBdrop_operator_family\fR(7)]
