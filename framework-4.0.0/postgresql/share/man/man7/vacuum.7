.SH NAME
VACUUM \- garbage-collect and optionally analyze a database

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] [ \fItable\fR ]
VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] ANALYZE [ \fItable\fR [ (\fIcolumn\fR [, ...] ) ] ]
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBVACUUM\fR reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples.
In normal PostgreSQL operation, tuples that
are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from
their table; they remain present until a \fBVACUUM\fR is
done. Therefore it's necessary to do \fBVACUUM\fR
periodically, especially on frequently-updated tables.
.PP
With no parameter, \fBVACUUM\fR processes every table in the
current database that the current user has permission to vacuum.
With a parameter, \fBVACUUM\fR processes only that table.
.PP
\fBVACUUM ANALYZE\fR performs a \fBVACUUM\fR
and then an \fBANALYZE\fR for each selected table. This
is a handy combination form for routine maintenance scripts. See
ANALYZE [\fBanalyze\fR(7)]
for more details about its processing.
.PP
Plain \fBVACUUM\fR (without FULL) simply reclaims
space and makes it
available for re-use. This form of the command can operate in parallel
with normal reading and writing of the table, as an exclusive lock
is not obtained. \fBVACUUM
FULL\fR does more extensive processing, including moving of tuples
across blocks to try to compact the table to the minimum number of disk
blocks. This form is much slower and requires an exclusive lock on each
table while it is being processed.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBFULL\fR
Selects ``full'' vacuum, which can reclaim more
space, but takes much longer and exclusively locks the table.
.TP
\fBFREEZE\fR
Selects aggressive ``freezing'' of tuples.
Specifying FREEZE is equivalent to performing
\fBVACUUM\fR with the
vacuum_freeze_min_age parameter
set to zero. The FREEZE option is deprecated and
will be removed in a future release; set the parameter instead.
.TP
\fBVERBOSE\fR
Prints a detailed vacuum activity report for each table.
.TP
\fBANALYZE\fR
Updates statistics used by the planner to determine the most
efficient way to execute a query.
.TP
\fB\fItable\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a specific table to
vacuum. Defaults to all tables in the current database.
.TP
\fB\fIcolumn\fB\fR
The name of a specific column to analyze. Defaults to all columns.
.SH "OUTPUTS"
.PP
When VERBOSE is specified, \fBVACUUM\fR emits
progress messages to indicate which table is currently being
processed. Various statistics about the tables are printed as well.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
To vacuum a table, one must ordinarily be the table's owner or a
superuser. However, database owners are allowed to
vacuum all tables in their databases, except shared catalogs.
(The restriction for shared catalogs means that a true database-wide
\fBVACUUM\fR can only be performed by a superuser.)
\fBVACUUM\fR will skip over any tables that the calling user
does not have permission to vacuum.
.PP
\fBVACUUM\fR cannot be executed inside a transaction block.
.PP
For tables with GIN indexes, \fBVACUUM\fR (in
any form) also completes any pending index insertions, by moving pending
index entries to the appropriate places in the main GIN index
structure. See in the documentation for details.
.PP
We recommend that active production databases be
vacuumed frequently (at least nightly), in order to
remove dead rows. After adding or deleting a large number
of rows, it might be a good idea to issue a \fBVACUUM
ANALYZE\fR command for the affected table. This will update the
system catalogs with
the results of all recent changes, and allow the
PostgreSQL query planner to make better
choices in planning queries.
.PP
The \fBFULL\fR option is not recommended for routine use,
but might be useful in special cases. An example is when you have deleted
or updated most of the rows in a table and would like the table to
physically shrink to occupy less disk space and allow faster table
scans. \fBVACUUM FULL\fR will usually shrink the table
more than a plain \fBVACUUM\fR would. The
\fBFULL\fR option does not shrink indexes; a periodic
\fBREINDEX\fR is still recommended. In fact, it is often faster
to drop all indexes, \fBVACUUM FULL\fR, and recreate the indexes.
.PP
\fBVACUUM\fR causes a substantial increase in I/O traffic,
which might cause poor performance for other active sessions. Therefore,
it is sometimes advisable to use the cost-based vacuum delay feature.
See in the documentation for details.
.PP
PostgreSQL includes an ``autovacuum''
facility which can automate routine vacuum maintenance. For more
information about automatic and manual vacuuming, see
in the documentation.

The following is an example from running \fBVACUUM\fR on a
table in the regression database:
