CHECKPOINT

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) puts a checkpoint in the transaction log
every so often. (To adjust the automatic checkpoint interval, see
the run-time configuration options checkpoint_segments
and checkpoint_timeout.) The
\fBCHECKPOINT\fR command forces an immediate
checkpoint when the command is issued, without waiting for a
scheduled checkpoint.
.PP
A checkpoint is a point in the transaction log sequence at which
all data files have been updated to reflect the information in the
log. All data files will be flushed to disk. Refer to
in the documentation for more information about the WAL system.
.PP
Only superusers can call \fBCHECKPOINT\fR. The command is
not intended for use during normal operation.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
The \fBCHECKPOINT\fR command is a
PostgreSQL language extension.
