.SH NAME
dropuser \- remove a PostgreSQL user account

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdropuser\fR [ \fB\fIoption\fB\fR\fI...\fR ]  [ \fB\fIusername\fB\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR removes an existing
PostgreSQL user.
Only superusers and users with the CREATEROLE privilege can
remove PostgreSQL users. (To remove a
superuser, you must yourself be a superuser.)
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR is a wrapper around the
SQL command DROP ROLE [\fBdrop_role\fR(7)].
There is no effective difference between dropping users via
this utility and via other methods for accessing the server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR accepts the following command-line arguments:
.TP
\fB\fIusername\fB\fR
Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL user to be removed. 
You will be prompted for a name if none is specified on the command line.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
.TP
\fB--echo\fR
Echo the commands that \fBdropuser\fR generates
and sends to the server.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
.TP
\fB--interactive\fR
Prompt for confirmation before actually removing the user.
.PP
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR also accepts the following
command-line arguments for connection parameters:
.TP
\fB-h \fIhost\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--host \fIhost\fB\fR
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the 
server
is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used 
as the directory for the Unix domain socket.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--port \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file 
extension on which the server
is listening for connections.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--username \fIusername\fB\fR
User name to connect as (not the user name to drop).
.TP
\fB-w\fR
.TP
\fB--no-password\fR
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a \fI.pgpass\fR file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.
.TP
\fB-W\fR
.TP
\fB--password\fR
Force \fBdropuser\fR to prompt for a
password before connecting to a database. 

This option is never essential, since
\fBdropuser\fR will automatically prompt
for a password if the server demands password authentication.
However, \fBdropuser\fR will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password.
In some cases it is worth typing \fB-W\fR to avoid the extra
connection attempt.
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGHOST\fR
.TP
\fBPGPORT\fR
.TP
\fBPGUSER\fR
Default connection parameters
.PP
This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities,
also uses the environment variables supported by \fBlibpq\fR
(see in the documentation).
.PP
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
In case of difficulty, see DROP ROLE [\fBdrop_role\fR(7)] and \fBpsql\fR(1) for
discussions of potential problems and error messages.
The database server must be running at the
targeted host. Also, any default connection settings and environment
variables used by the \fBlibpq\fR front-end
library will apply.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To remove user joe from the default database
server:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBdropuser joe\fR
.sp
.fi
.PP
To remove user joe using the server on host
eden, port 5000, with verification and a peek at the underlying
command:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBdropuser -p 5000 -h eden -i -e joe\fR
Role "joe" will be permanently removed.
Are you sure? (y/n) \fBy\fR
DROP ROLE joe;
.sp
.fi
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBcreateuser\fR(1), DROP ROLE [\fBdrop_role\fR(7)]
