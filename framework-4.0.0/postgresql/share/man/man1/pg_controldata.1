.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpg_controldata\fR [ \fB\fIdatadir\fB\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpg_controldata\fR prints information initialized during
\fBinitdb\fR, such as the catalog version.
It also shows information about write-ahead logging and checkpoint 
processing. This information is cluster-wide, and not specific to any one
database.
.PP
This utility can only be run by the user who initialized the cluster because
it requires read access to the data directory.
You can specify the data directory on the command line, or use 
the environment variable \fBPGDATA\fR.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGDATA\fR
Default data directory location
