.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBclusterdb\fR is a utility for reclustering tables
in a PostgreSQL database. It finds tables
that have previously been clustered, and clusters them again on the same
index that was last used. Tables that have never been clustered are not
affected.
.PP
\fBclusterdb\fR is a wrapper around the SQL
command CLUSTER [\fBcluster\fR(7)].
There is no effective difference between clustering databases via
this utility and via other methods for accessing the server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBclusterdb\fR accepts the following command-line arguments:
.TP
\fB-a\fR
.TP
\fB--all\fR
Cluster all databases.
.TP
\fB[-d] \fIdbname\fB\fR
.TP
\fB[--dbname] \fIdbname\fB\fR
Specifies the name of the database to be clustered.
If this is not specified and \fB-a\fR (or
\fB--all\fR) is not used, the database name is read
from the environment variable \fBPGDATABASE\fR. If
that is not set, the user name specified for the connection is
used.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
.TP
\fB--echo\fR
Echo the commands that \fBclusterdb\fR generates
and sends to the server.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
.TP
\fB--quiet\fR
Do not display progress messages.
.TP
\fB-t \fItable\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--table \fItable\fB\fR
Cluster \fItable\fR only.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR
Print detailed information during processing.
.PP
.PP
\fBclusterdb\fR also accepts 
the following command-line arguments for connection parameters:
.TP
\fB-h \fIhost\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--host \fIhost\fB\fR
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is
running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the
directory for the Unix domain socket.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--port \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file 
extension on which the server
is listening for connections.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--username \fIusername\fB\fR
User name to connect as.
.TP
\fB-w\fR
.TP
\fB--no-password\fR
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a \fI.pgpass\fR file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.
.TP
\fB-W\fR
.TP
\fB--password\fR
Force \fBclusterdb\fR to prompt for a
password before connecting to a database. 

This option is never essential, since
\fBclusterdb\fR will automatically prompt
for a password if the server demands password authentication.
However, \fBclusterdb\fR will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password.
In some cases it is worth typing \fB-W\fR to avoid the extra
connection attempt.
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGDATABASE\fR
.TP
\fBPGHOST\fR
.TP
\fBPGPORT\fR
.TP
\fBPGUSER\fR
Default connection parameters
.PP
This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities,
also uses the environment variables supported by \fBlibpq\fR
(see in the documentation).
.PP
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
In case of difficulty, see CLUSTER [\fBcluster\fR(7)] and \fBpsql\fR(1) for
discussions of potential problems and error messages.
The database server must be running at the
targeted host. Also, any default connection settings and environment
variables used by the \fBlibpq\fR front-end
library will apply.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To cluster the database test:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBclusterdb test\fR
.sp
.fi
.PP
To cluster a single table
foo in a database named
xyzzy:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBclusterdb --table foo xyzzy\fR
.sp
.fi
.SH "SEE ALSO"
CLUSTER [\fBcluster\fR(7)]
