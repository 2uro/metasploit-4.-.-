.SH NAME
pg_config \- retrieve information about the installed version of PostgreSQL

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBpg_config\fR [ \fB\fIoption\fB\fR\fI...\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBpg_config\fR utility prints configuration parameters
of the currently installed version of PostgreSQL. It is
intended, for example, to be used by software packages that want to interface
to PostgreSQL to facilitate finding the required header files
and libraries.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
To use \fBpg_config\fR, supply one or more of the following
options:
.TP
\fB--bindir\fR
Print the location of user executables. Use this, for example, to find
the \fBpsql\fR program. This is normally also the location
where the \fIpg_config\fR program resides. 
.TP
\fB--docdir\fR
Print the location of documentation files.
.TP
\fB--htmldir\fR
Print the location of HTML documentation files.
.TP
\fB--includedir\fR
Print the location of C header files of the client interfaces.
.TP
\fB--pkgincludedir\fR
Print the location of other C header files.
.TP
\fB--includedir-server\fR
Print the location of C header files for server programming.
.TP
\fB--libdir\fR
Print the location of object code libraries.
.TP
\fB--pkglibdir\fR
Print the location of dynamically loadable modules, or where
the server would search for them. (Other
architecture-dependent data files might also be installed in this
directory.)
.TP
\fB--localedir\fR
Print the location of locale support files. (This will be an empty
string if locale support was not configured when
PostgreSQL was built.)
.TP
\fB--mandir\fR
Print the location of manual pages.
.TP
\fB--sharedir\fR
Print the location of architecture-independent support files.
.TP
\fB--sysconfdir\fR
Print the location of system-wide configuration files.
.TP
\fB--pgxs\fR
Print the location of extension makefiles.
.TP
\fB--configure\fR
Print the options that were given to the \fIconfigure\fR
script when PostgreSQL was configured for building.
This can be used to reproduce the identical configuration, or
to find out with what options a binary package was built. (Note
however that binary packages often contain vendor-specific custom
patches.) See also the examples below.
.TP
\fB--cc\fR
Print the value of the CC variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL. This shows the C compiler used.
.TP
\fB--cppflags\fR
Print the value of the CPPFLAGS variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL. This shows C compiler switches needed
at preprocessing time (typically, -I switches).
.TP
\fB--cflags\fR
Print the value of the CFLAGS variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL. This shows C compiler switches.
.TP
\fB--cflags_sl\fR
Print the value of the CFLAGS_SL variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL. This shows extra C compiler switches
used for building shared libraries.
.TP
\fB--ldflags\fR
Print the value of the LDFLAGS variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL. This shows linker switches.
.TP
\fB--ldflags_sl\fR
Print the value of the LDFLAGS_SL variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL. This shows linker switches
used for building shared libraries.
.TP
\fB--libs\fR
Print the value of the LIBS variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL. This normally contains -l
switches for external libraries linked into PostgreSQL.
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Print the version of PostgreSQL.
.PP
If more than one option is given, the information is printed in that order,
one item per line. If no options are given, all available information
is printed, with labels.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The option \fB--includedir-server\fR was new in
PostgreSQL 7.2. In prior releases, the server include files were
installed in the same location as the client headers, which could
be queried with the option \fB--includedir\fR. To make your
package handle both cases, try the newer option first and test the
exit status to see whether it succeeded.
.PP
The options \fB--docdir\fR, \fB--pkgincludedir\fR,
\fB--localedir\fR, \fB--mandir\fR,
\fB--sharedir\fR, \fB--sysconfdir\fR,
\fB--cc\fR, \fB--cppflags\fR,
\fB--cflags\fR, \fB--cflags_sl\fR,
\fB--ldflags\fR, \fB--ldflags_sl\fR,
and \fB--libs\fR are new in PostgreSQL 8.1.
The option \fB--htmldir\fR is new in PostgreSQL 8.4.
.PP
In releases prior to PostgreSQL 7.1, before
\fBpg_config\fR came to be, a method for finding the
equivalent configuration information did not exist.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
To reproduce the build configuration of the current PostgreSQL
installation, run the following command:
.sp
.nf
eval ./configure `pg_config --configure`
.sp
.fi
The output of pg_config --configure contains
shell quotation marks so arguments with spaces are represented
correctly. Therefore, using eval is required
for proper results.
