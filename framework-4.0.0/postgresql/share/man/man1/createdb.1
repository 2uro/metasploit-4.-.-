.SH NAME
createdb \- create a new PostgreSQL database

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBcreatedb\fR [ \fB\fIoption\fB\fR\fI...\fR ]  [ \fB\fIdbname\fB\fR ]  [ \fB\fIdescription\fB\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcreatedb\fR creates a new PostgreSQL
database.
.PP
Normally, the database user who executes this command becomes the owner of
the new database.
However a different owner can be specified via the \fB-O\fR
option, if the executing user has appropriate privileges.
.PP
\fBcreatedb\fR is a wrapper around the
SQL command CREATE DATABASE [\fBcreate_database\fR(7)].
There is no effective difference between creating databases via
this utility and via other methods for accessing the server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBcreatedb\fR accepts the following command-line arguments:
.TP
\fB\fIdbname\fB\fR
Specifies the name of the database to be created. The name must be
unique among all PostgreSQL databases in this cluster.
The default is to create a database with the same name as the
current system user.
.TP
\fB\fIdescription\fB\fR
Specifies a comment to be associated with the newly created
database.
.TP
\fB-D \fItablespace\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--tablespace \fItablespace\fB\fR
Specifies the default tablespace for the database.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
.TP
\fB--echo\fR
Echo the commands that \fBcreatedb\fR generates
and sends to the server.
.TP
\fB-l \fIlocale\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--locale \fIlocale\fB\fR
Specifies the locale to be used in this database. This is equivalent
to specifying both \fB--lc-collate\fR and \fB--lc-ctype\fR.
.TP
\fB--lc-collate \fIlocale\fB\fR
Specifies the LC_COLLATE setting to be used in this database.
.TP
\fB--lc-ctype \fIlocale\fB\fR
Specifies the LC_CTYPE setting to be used in this database.
.TP
\fB-E \fIencoding\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--encoding \fIencoding\fB\fR
Specifies the character encoding scheme to be used in this
database. The character sets supported by the
PostgreSQL server are described in
in the documentation.
.TP
\fB-O \fIowner\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--owner \fIowner\fB\fR
Specifies the database user who will own the new database.
.TP
\fB-T \fItemplate\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--template \fItemplate\fB\fR
Specifies the template database from which to build this database.
.PP
.PP
The options \fB-D\fR, \fB-E\fR, \fB-l\fR,
\fB-O\fR, and
\fB-T\fR correspond to options of the underlying
SQL command CREATE DATABASE [\fBcreate_database\fR(7)]; see there for more information
about them.
.PP
\fBcreatedb\fR also accepts the following
command-line arguments for connection parameters:
.TP
\fB-h \fIhost\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--host \fIhost\fB\fR
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the 
server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used 
as the directory for the Unix domain socket.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--port \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the TCP port or the local Unix domain socket file 
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--username \fIusername\fB\fR
User name to connect as.
.TP
\fB-w\fR
.TP
\fB--no-password\fR
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a \fI.pgpass\fR file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.
.TP
\fB-W\fR
.TP
\fB--password\fR
Force \fBcreatedb\fR to prompt for a
password before connecting to a database. 

This option is never essential, since
\fBcreatedb\fR will automatically prompt
for a password if the server demands password authentication.
However, \fBcreatedb\fR will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password.
In some cases it is worth typing \fB-W\fR to avoid the extra
connection attempt.
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGDATABASE\fR
If set, the name of the database to create, unless overridden on
the command line.
.TP
\fBPGHOST\fR
.TP
\fBPGPORT\fR
.TP
\fBPGUSER\fR
Default connection parameters. \fBPGUSER\fR also
determines the name of the database to create, if it is not
specified on the command line or by \fBPGDATABASE\fR.
.PP
This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities,
also uses the environment variables supported by \fBlibpq\fR
(see in the documentation).
.PP
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
In case of difficulty, see CREATE DATABASE [\fBcreate_database\fR(7)] and \fBpsql\fR(1) for
discussions of potential problems and error messages.
The database server must be running at the
targeted host. Also, any default connection settings and environment
variables used by the \fBlibpq\fR front-end
library will apply.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To create the database demo using the default
database server:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBcreatedb demo\fR
.sp
.fi
.PP
To create the database demo using the
server on host eden, port 5000, using the
LATIN1 encoding scheme with a look at the
underlying command:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBcreatedb -p 5000 -h eden -E LATIN1 -e demo\fR
CREATE DATABASE demo ENCODING 'LATIN1';
.sp
.fi
