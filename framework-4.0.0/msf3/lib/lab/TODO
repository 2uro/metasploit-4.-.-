This is a list of basic priorities for the lab code...

* Implement more technologies

 a) finish amazon ec2 (via fog)
 b) qemu
 c) qemudo
 d) kvm
 e) other cloud technologies (newservers, slicehost/rackspace,etc)

* Implement a cloning function on each controller

* Support Windows as a host platform. Currently all the code assumes a linux host is running it. The same applies for the remote_* drivers -- they've not been tested on windows.

* Consolidate the remote_system_command code & provide a filter. Create an unsafe_system_command and unsafe_remote_system_command function call for when we control the entire string.
